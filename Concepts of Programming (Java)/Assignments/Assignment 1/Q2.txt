PATH:-

PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located.

It specifies the directories in which executable programs* are located on the machine that can be started 
without knowing and typing the whole path to the file on the command line. 

In general, each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting.
